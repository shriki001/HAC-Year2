File    : ex3a.c
Purpose : In this program the father process defines an array and pefroms the
          following 10 times:
           - raffles numbers into the array.
           - creates 2 children that sorting the array (first bubble-sort,
             the other one quick-sort)

          The father process gets trough the pipe how much time it took
          for each one to sort the array.

          the first raffles a number 10 times and creating a child process
          that search the array before it sorted (doing similarly a search
          after the array is sorted)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile : gcc -Wall ex3a.c -o ex3a
Run     : ex3a

Input : Nothing.

Output: from The 2 first children:
        time it took to do it sort, which sort it performed, the minimum
        and the maximum values in the array.

        announcement the the 3rd child(son of the father process) performed
        a sequential search and time it took, as well the same data for the
         4th child (son of the 1st child, performed a binary search).

RunTime: NULL

File    : ex3b.c
Purpose : This program created an array of raffled numbers and create N
          child processes, each one look at a part of the array cells, cells
          are by the reminder of the index in NUM_OF_CHILDERN is index.
          (For example: if there are 5 children ,the 1st child is in charge of
          looking at arr[1],arr[6],arr[11]... ,etc).
          all children sent the prime numbers they found to the father and
          the father sort these value, than prints and finish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile : gcc -Wall ex3b.c -o ex3b
Run     : ex3b

Input: Nothing.

Output: The (prime) values that got from the children processes,at sorted order
 
RunTime: NULL

===============================================================================

File    : ex3c.c
Purpose : In this program the father process creates 2 children. each child 
		  raffle a series of numbers that contain only in range [-1,1].
		  each child when raffle 0 - sent it to the father.
		  the first children, when raffled -1 sent to his brother; when raffled
		  1 , grows his counter by 1. in simetric way for the 2nd child.
		  When a process's counter reaches N - he kills the to other and finish
  	 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile : gcc -Wall ex3c.c -o ex3c
Run     : ex3c

Input: Nothing.

Output: The number that the 'winner' process counted
 
RunTime: NULL

Race mode : all processes runnig together, no one wait for anoter so it can be 
	    1 to 3 winners in the program depend if some process get to N first
