File    : ex7a.c
Purpose : This Program use as the SERVER program.
          and allows execution of 3 functions:
          1) function that get a string, and return if its a palindrome
          2) function that get a double number, and return if its power by 2
          3) function that get a char, and 2 integers and return the
             result of the char on them (e.g "+ 1 3" will return 4(= 1 + 3).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile : gcc rpc_gen_svc.c ex7a.c -lm -o ex7a
Run     : ex7a1

Input : Nothing.

Output: Nothing.

RunTime: Linear as input size

File    : ex7b.c
Purpose : This Program use as the CLIENT program.
          It will run in loop, in each iteration, the program reads from the
          user which operation he wants to do (a number in range 0-3) and the
          right data that required for the operation. it got the value that
          return from the server and present it to the user.
          Runs as long as user don't ask to exit

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile : gcc rpc_gen_clnt.c ex7b.c -o ex7b
Run     : ex7b <SERVER IP>  only after running ex7a // e.g: ./ex7b localhost

Input: a number (0-3) of operation to do.

Output: the result got from the server (number).
 
RunTime: Linear as input size
